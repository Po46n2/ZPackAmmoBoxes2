# ZPack Ammo Boxes 2
Mod for the game Barotrauma

Added Items:
Revolver Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 4 revolver round stacks)
Shotgun Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 2 shotgun shell stacks)
Harpoon Stack (Container holding a maximum of 2 harpoon stacks)
SMG Magazine Stack (Container holding a maximum of 2 SMG magazines)

The ammo boxes are small items that can be stored anywhere except the harpoonstack.
To make it a bit more realistic the harpoonstack is medium so it won't fit in a toolbox and some other small containers.

A movable content window opens when any of the items are equiped(taken in had) to make reloading a little less clumsy. 
(If you find that annoying, don't equip them, just use from the inventory.)

Having two containers equiped at the same time is buggy. 
The content window of one doesn't always appear even if they are not overlapping.


If you are using the original mod ZPackAmmoBox:
The original mod was created before item stacking was added to the game so that one got overpowered.
Lowering the boxes capacity there could have caused items to b lost for players alread using that mod. 
To avoid this I have created theis mod with balanced container capacity.
Please buy these new boxes, transfer the ammo and destroy the old boxes (Old ones are marked with the word Big)

Stacking should have made this mod obsolete, but the devs didn't balance anything just made everything stack to 8. So now 8 revolver bullets still take the same amount of space as 8 handgrenades...
(The best would be to rebalance the stacking capacity, but doing that in a mod would override the vanila items and that could cause problems later when they change something.)
